# Quality control for RNA-seq data

In a bioinformatics pipeline with a focus on RNA-seq, the first step to be done is the assessment of raw data quality [Sheng et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27687708/). Depending on the quality of these data, it is necessary to filter them in order to remove low quality sequences or nucleotides, adapters, over-represented sequences ensuring a more reliable final result.
